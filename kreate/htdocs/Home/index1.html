		<p class="test"> Kreate technology were we stive to be the best in the the technology industry
		  Like all great innovations RealTIME was built out of necessity. Specifically, it was designed to help a creative team cope with positive business growth, differentiate from competitors and become more efficient and profitable. </p>

		<p class="test"> After investigating the many project management packages available in the market and realizing none of them were designed with creatives in mind, OneKreate, a thriving creative agency, realized that there was a gap in the marketplace. All of the existing products were complex, had legacy interfaces that creatives would not embrace, and relied on old technologies that were increasingly incompatible with the modern mobile-centric world. Simply put, they did not serve the needs of the creative community and required too much behavior modification for successful adoption. </p>
